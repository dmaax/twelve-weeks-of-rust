## üö® Critical Points of Attention

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Week 6 (DNS Client)** - MOST IMPORTANT
This project teaches you EVERYTHING you need for Minecraft:
- Binary protocol parsing
- Big-endian byte order
- Variable-length fields
- Network packet handling

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Week 10 (VarInt)** - FUNDAMENTAL
VarInt is used in EVERY Minecraft packet. If you don't master this, nothing will work.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Tests are Mandatory**
Every project must have tests. Networking bugs are hard to debug.
